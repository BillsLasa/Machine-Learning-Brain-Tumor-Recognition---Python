# Machine Learning Brain Tumor Recognition - Python
This repository stores the code responsible for training and validating a machine learning model to recognize brain tumors in MRI scans. In addition to the graphical user interface that uses this artificial intelligence model to show the user if there is a tumor or not, in addition to showing a possible location in one of the lobes of the brain.

## Folders description 📁

* **[Model_Training]**: This folder contains all the Python code files and notebooks where a machine learning model, specifically the random forest algorithm, was trained and validated.

* **[GUI]**: This folder contains all the Python code files and images that make up the graphical user interface that will show the user whether or not there is a tumor in an magnetic resonance imaging. It also contains the code that locates the tumor in the corresponding lobe.

## Main Files description 📘

* **[Identificación de muestras - Obtención de Datos.ipynb]**: This file contains the code documented in a notebook using google colab that extracts the necessary features to train and validate the KNN machine learning model by differentiating between one type of sample and another.

* **[Identificación de muestras - K Nearest Neighbors (Machine Learning).ipynb]**: This file contains the code documented in a notebook using google colab that trains and validates the KNN machine learning model to classify laboratory samples.
