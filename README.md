# Machine Learning Brain Tumor Recognition - Python
This repository stores the code responsible for training and validating a machine learning model to recognize brain tumors in MRI scans. In addition to the graphical user interface that uses this artificial intelligence model to show the user if there is a tumor or not, in addition to showing a possible location in one of the lobes of the brain.

## Folders description 📁

* **[Modelo]**: This folder contains the Matlab code that simulates a DC motor as a reference model to which the motor should be adapted when the inertia varies. The folder stores the matlab code and the simulink file with the mathematical model of the motor.

* **[Etapa2-Obtencion_Dataset]**: This folder contains the Matlab code that obtains data from 2000 mathematical models of DC motors built in simulink that differ by a small variation in inertia. 

## Main Files description 📘

* **[Identificación de muestras - Obtención de Datos.ipynb]**: This file contains the code documented in a notebook using google colab that extracts the necessary features to train and validate the KNN machine learning model by differentiating between one type of sample and another.

* **[Identificación de muestras - K Nearest Neighbors (Machine Learning).ipynb]**: This file contains the code documented in a notebook using google colab that trains and validates the KNN machine learning model to classify laboratory samples.
